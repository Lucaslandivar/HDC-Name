<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p>I've always had a hard time creating or thinking of a name for my projects (I think I noticed it in my previous projects) so I decided to use this as a challenge for my next project, where I made a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
</p> 

<h2>Why i make this project?</h2>
<p>I make this project so i can learn how to make JavaScript generate things and random names and adding those names into the value the user gives me.</p>

<h2>How does this project work?</h2>
<P>When you write a word, the word you wrote return with a word Generate from JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Tecnologies</h2>

<p>JavaScript</p>

<h2>Status</h2>
<p>Finish.</p>
